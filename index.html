					<h2>Abstract </h2>
					<blockquote>

					Student loan debt is a growing problem in our society and directly impacting the financial decisions and livelihood of young professionals. A survey conducted by American Student Assistance (ASA) found that many students are crippled by huge loans, delaying their decisions to get married, have kids, enter their desired career, retire, and even buy houses (SALT, 2013). House prices are influenced by variety of factors, some of which are neighborhood, social and physical characteristics, accessibility, and the environment (Kauko, 2003). Crime rates are another factor that influences housing costs. In particular, assisted housing programs have been shown to have a negative effect on crime, effectively lowering crime rates and prompting lower amounts of crime in nearby communities as well (National Low Income Housing Coalition, 2011). 
					
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>The purpose of this project is to design a web application that will allow users to cross-reference data from crime statistics and housing costs and see if they have any correlation to student default rates per city. This project will assist users in picking the perfect place to live, whether they are single or have kids. This application will simplify the process of buying the ideal home.
